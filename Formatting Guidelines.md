# Images
- All images are .webp and in the matching folder.
- Screen images are taken by Wall for higher detail.
- MO2 images are taken with the default theme.

# Section Formatting
- All sections have a comment above.
- Section titles are <h2>.
- Subtitles are <h3>.
- Comments match the name in the sidenav. The tags also match.
- All sections in a tutorial page (such as Setup or MO2) are separated with 1 <br>.
- <hr> is only used for the top and bottom of pages.
- Paragraphs in the same section are separated by 2 <br>.
- If it helps readability, phrases can be separated by a single <br>.

# Grammar
- American English.
- Punctuation everywhere.
    - Lists of instructions end in full stop.
    - Lists of single items end in comma then full stop at the last entry (for example in FOMOD instructions).
    - Lists ending in <code> should not get punctuation.
- Avoid referring to ourselves with singular forms (e.g. "I think the best theme is..."), refer to us as "we" but try to generalize info.

# Highlighting
- <strong> is reserved for words that are very important to the current section or set of instructions, or are able to quick summarize them at a glance.
- Bold text is for any mention of particular terms such as Root, or for prompts/buttons on screen that the user might see while following instructions.
- Underline is for words that do not meet the criteria above but are often missed by users, you can see this as a subtle highlight but lower in hierarchy than the other 2.

# Mods
- File section with file name.
- If there's any extra files from external pages, link the page then the file as sublist.
- FOMOD instructions are simply an ordered list with the exact entries and buttons to click in each step. Refer to # Grammar.

# Blockquotes
- Used for additional notes to the relevant section. Place among instructions or at the end depending on the situation.
- The important blockquote with Coco is used only for critical information that, if missed, would lead to things such as crashing or bugs.

# Changelog
- DD/MM/YY.
- All changelogs are separated by an <hr>.
- An update can be:
    - Safe Mid-Game
    - NOT Safe Mid-game (Unless...)
- Log all entries except:
    - Formatting changes that do not invalidate the previous.
    - Wabbajack reuploads due to small errors such as versioning.
    - Information rewrites that do not invalidate the previous.
    - Files on the VNV Resources page, these will be logged through the Wabbajack entry in the changelog that says: "Updated the following mods".
    - Updates to MO2 ML, same reason as above.
- If an operation (added/updated/removed) is done multiple times, turn it into a list.
