# Images
- All images are .webp and in the matching folder.
- Screen images are taken by Wall for higher detail.
- MO2 images are taken with the default theme.

# Grammar
- American English.
- Punctuation everywhere.
    - Lists of instructions end in full stop.
    - Lists of single items end in comma then full stop at the last entry (for example in FOMOD instructions).
    - Lists ending in <code> should not get punctuation.
- Avoid referring to ourselves with singular forms (e.g. "I think the best theme is..."), refer to us as "we" but try to generalize info.

# Highlighting
- <strong> is reserved for words that are very important to the current section or set of instructions, or are able to quick summarize them at a glance.
- Bold text is for any mention of particular terms such as Root, or for prompts/buttons on screen that the user might see while following instructions.
- Underline is for words that do not meet the criteria above but are often missed by users, you can see this as a subtle highlight but lower in hierarchy than the other 2.
- Green cards are for information that wouldn't lead to issues even if ignored.
- Yellow cards are for information that the user needs to be aware of.
- Red cards are for information that, if ignored, would lead to bugs, crashes, and big wastes of time.
- Coco Nerd is for red cards, "Everything in this guide is written down for a reason!", and "If you run into any issues at any point in the guide".
- Only center the "Everything in this guide is written down for a reason!", "If you run into any issues at any point in the guide", and "Enable all resources" cards.
- No Coco Nerd for "If you already uninstalled the games" because they would take too much space.

# Mods
- File section with file name.
- If there's any extra files from external pages, link the page then the file as sublist.
- FOMOD instructions are simply an ordered list with the exact entries and buttons to click in each step. Refer to the Grammar section.

# Blockquotes
- Used for additional notes to the relevant section. Place among instructions or at the end depending on the situation.
- The important blockquote with Coco is used only for critical information that, if missed, would lead to things such as crashing or bugs.
