# Images
- All images are .webp and in the matching folder.
- MO2 images are taken with the default theme.

# Grammar
- American English.
- Punctuation everywhere except in the file name lines (Main Files etc...) and FOMOD steps.
- Lists of instructions end in full stop.
- Lists of single items end in comma then full stop at the last entry.
- List entries ending in spans should not get punctuation.
- Avoid referring to ourselves with singular forms (e.g. "I think the best theme is..."), refer to us as "we" but try to generalize info.

# Highlighting
- Strong is reserved for words that are very important to the current section or set of instructions, or are able to quick summarize them at a glance.
- Bold text is for any mention of particular terms such as Root, or for prompts/buttons on screen that the user might see while following instructions. The exceptions to this are:
  - You can NOT skip any paragraphs/instructions and expect your game to function as it should.
  - ARM64 systems are NOT supported due to Mod Organizer 2's lack of support.
  - In Installation Location select an empty folder that is NOT the following:
  - Moved x to the new section.
- Underline is for words that do not meet the criteria above but are often missed by users, you can see this as a subtle highlight but lower in hierarchy than the other 2.

# Note Cards
- Basic cards are for paths, text that should be copied, and formulas like the VRR bias.
- Green cards are for information that wouldn't lead to issues even if ignored.
- Yellow cards are for information that the user needs to be aware of.
- Red cards are for information that, if ignored, would lead to bugs, crashes, and big wastes of time.
- Coco Nerd is only for "Everything in this guide is written down for a reason!" in the Introduction and Wabbajack pages.
- Only center the "Everything in this guide is written down for a reason!", "If you run into any issues at any point in the guide", and "Enable all resources" cards.

# Mods
- Mod descriptions are rewritten for clarity.
- If there's any extra files from external pages, link the page then the file as sublist.
- FOMOD instructions are simply an ordered list with the exact entries and buttons to click in each step. Refer to the Grammar section.

# Changelog
- DD/MM/YY.
- An update can be:
    - Safe Mid-Game
